EasyStorage
===========

A library for easy cross-platform file in XNA and Monogame.

For an example of how to use this lib, check out the sample app at https://github.com/dmanning23/EasyStorageSample

This library has been tested on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
